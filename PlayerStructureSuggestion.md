# Question
I have a java project that is an online game, but online!



I have following packages..

-api

-services

-domain

-providers

-websockets



And they all have some sub-packages and so on.



In domain, I have the game package which contains a lot of logic, including a class called Deck with it's own classes and records (models)



Since a deck is part of the game, it's currently placed in the game. But should it be placed alongside the game, in the domain package?



Same with player. The player obj stores name and stats. But also a connectionInfo obj that tells whether a client has connected and assumed the identity of the player (nothing is stored, and everything is deleted when the game is over)



Player is tied to and serves the game. But it also have a bunch of classes and records for itself that makes up a player. Also it's used though the project for communication both with the Game instance and the client connected.

# Answer

This is a great question, and it gets to the very heart of good software architecture, specifically Separation of Concerns and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

Your package structure (api, services, domain, etc.) is a good start. The domain package should be the pure, core logic of your game, independent of how it's delivered (web, websockets, etc.).

Here's how to think about your Deck and Player problems.

🧠 1. The Deck Package
Your instinct is correct. A Deck is a concept that is fundamentally part of the Game.

In Domain-Driven Design, we talk about Aggregates. An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. Your Game is almost certainly an "Aggregate Root"—the main entry point for any changes to game state.

The Deck, the Player objects (in the context of the game), and the GameBoard are all part of the Game aggregate. Their lifecycle is bound to the Game: when the Game starts, they are created; when the Game ends, they are destroyed.

Recommendation: Keep Deck inside your game package.

Good: domain.game.Deck (or domain.game.model.Deck)

Also Good (if complex): domain.game.deck.Deck (if the deck logic is huge and needs its own sub-package)

Less Good: domain.Deck (This implies a Deck is a top-level concept, equal to a Game, which is probably not true for your system.)

🎮 2. The Player Object (The Core Issue)
You've perfectly identified the problem: your Player object is mixing two different concerns:

Domain Logic: name, stats, hand, score (the rules of the player).

Application/Infrastructure Logic: connectionInfo (the state of the client connection).

This violates the principle of your domain layer. Your core domain.game.Player object should not know or care if a player is connected via a WebSocket, an HTTP request, or if they are an AI.

The solution is to split the concept of a "Player" into two distinct classes in two different layers.

The Domain Model: domain.game.Player
This is your pure domain object. It lives inside the domain.game package (just like Deck) because it's part of the Game aggregate.

Package: domain.game.Player

Contains: name, stats, hand, score, and domain methods like drawCard(), takeDamage(), etc.

Does NOT Contain: Any connectionInfo, WebSocket sessions, or userIds from a database. It's just the pure game representation.

The Application/Session Model: PlayerSession
This object represents the connected client and lives outside the domain. It's an Application or Infrastructure concern. It acts as the bridge between the transport layer (WebSockets) and the domain.

Package: services.PlayerSession (or websockets.PlayerConnection)

Contains:

connectionInfo (e.g., the WebSocket session object)

playerId (the ID of the domain.game.Player this session controls)

gameId (the ID of the Game this session is in)

Responsibility: Manages the connection, sends messages to the client, and receives messages from the client.

How They Work Together
Your GameService (in the services package) and your WebSocketController (in websockets) orchestrate everything.

Example Flow: Player Plays a Card

Client: The client (browser) sends a WebSocket message: { "action": "playCard", "cardId": "c45" }.

websockets Layer: Your WebSocketController receives this message. From the connection, it gets the PlayerSession.

services Layer: The WebSocketController calls gameService.playCard(session.getPlayerId(), "c45").

services Layer (cont.): The GameService:

Loads the Game aggregate from memory or a database.

Gets the pure domain.game.Player object using playerId.

Calls the pure domain logic: game.getPlayer(playerId).playCard("c45").

domain Layer: The Game and Player objects run their internal logic. They update their state (e.g., the card is moved from the Player's hand to the discard pile). The Game might emit a "domain event" like PlayerPlayedCardEvent.

services Layer (Response): The GameService sees the state has changed. It then uses the PlayerSession objects for all players in the game to send WebSocket messages back, informing them of the update.

By doing this, your domain logic stays pure, testable, and completely separate from your connection logic.

✅ Summary & Recommendation
Deck: Keep it in domain.game. It's part of the Game aggregate.

Player: Refactor this.

Create a pure domain.game.Player with only game logic (stats, hand, etc.).

Create a PlayerSession (or PlayerConnection) class in your services or websockets package to hold the connectionInfo and the playerId.

Use your GameService to bridge the gap, translating "web" requests from the PlayerSession into "domain" actions on the domain.game.Player.

This separation will make your project much easier to maintain, test, and expand in the future.
